      </div>

    <p>I stand behind creating repeatable systems to increase accuracy, efficiency, and transparancy in one of the top 5 largest brick and mortar school districts in Pennsylvania.  Throughout my 30 year career I have used technology to streamline and automate tasks, creating tools to track products, people, and processes.  I consistently look for ways to increase my knowledge and skillset, and am part way through MIT's Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Developer with MERN.  Some of my most recent impactful projects have included:</p>
  
      <li>all marketing, scheduling, and logistics for a one-day career fair of 120+ workshop speakers where students attended their top 6 choices.</li>

      <li>established an online tracking system for teacher absences and subsequent class coverages that increased transparency, teacher participation, and overall building morale.</li>

      <li>established an automated method to evaluate student graduation eligibility based on newly established state regulations, and swiftly established a process to foster open communication regarding specific cases parents, students, and staff.</li>

    <p>Outside of work, I am focused on completing a Certificate in Coding : Full Stack Development with MERN through MIT.</p>
